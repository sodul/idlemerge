# idlemerge
Merging is a time consuming task. Often times code patched into a release of stabilisation branch need to be committed back to Trunk. Being able to commit once and know that the merge will automatically happen within minutes boosts productivity.

We use IdleMerge to automatically merge thousands of commits per month with a low rate of conflicts.
